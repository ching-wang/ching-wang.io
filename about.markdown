Hello, my name is Qing (pronounced "Ching"). I'm currently working at
[DBpixelhouse](https://www.dbpixelhouse.com/) as a junior full-stack software engineer, using React, 
JavaScript, SASS, node.js and the AWS platform among other technologies to
deliver projects for clients including AstraZeneca, ITV, Shell and Dixons.

This site is mainly for my learning notes and sharing things I like.  

## A little bit more about me

I grew up in an environment where technology wasn't very common. However, I'm
curious about all new things and have always sought to learn about them. A long
time ago, I learned how to use a computer in my own time to move from the
factory floor to an office job. From there, I started to learn English in my own
time and then decided to learn English to go to university. 

After studying and working for five years in Shanghai, I moved to the UK. In my
previous role at a British import/export company, I found many chances to
automate small pieces of work with Python. I knew that I would like to pursue it
further and learn how to write software, which I did at Flatiron School London.
Flatiron is a software engineering boot-camp that teaches a range of full-stack
web technologies over several months: [Software
Engineering](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/london)
course at [Flatiron School London](https://flatironschool.com/campuses/london).

The comprehensive full-stack curriculum at Flatiron equipped me with knowledge
of software engineering across the web technology stack (see below). I gained
practical, applicable software engineering skills and have been putting them to
use in [a range of projects](/projects).
