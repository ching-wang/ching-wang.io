Hello, my name is Qing (pronounced like "Ching"). I'm currently a student at
Flatiron School learning software engineering. I'm on my way to be a full
stack developer. 

This site is mainly for my learning notes and also for sharing things I do.
About my notes, if there is anything incorrect, please let me know. Thank you! 

## A little bit more about myself

I grow up in an environment where technology wasn't very common. However, I'm
curious about all new things and have always sought to learn about them. I
learned how to use a computer in my own time to move from the factory floor to
an office job. From there, I started to learn English in my own time and then
decided to learn English to go to university after several years. 

Studying and working for five years in Shanghai, I decided to move to the UK.
In my previous role at a British import/export company, I have been finding
chances to automate small pieces of work with Python. I know that I would like
to take this much further and make it the next stage of my career.
