Hello, my name is Qing (pronounced "Ching"). I have just graduated from
[Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) as a full stack software engineer
in London. I have passion for programming and solving real world problems with
software. I am looking for an opportunity to start next stage of my career.

This site is mainly for my learning notes and also for sharing things I do.
If there is anything incorrect, please let me know. Thank you! 

## A little bit more about me

I grew up in an environment where technology wasn't very common. However, I'm
curious about all new things and have always sought to learn about them. I
learned how to use a computer in my own time to move from the factory floor to
an office job. From there, I started to learn English in my own time and then
decided to learn English to go to university. 

After studying and working for five years in Shanghai, I moved to the UK. More
recently in my previous role at a British import/export company, I found many
chances to automate small pieces of work with Python. I knew that I would like
to pursue it further and learn how to write software, which I did at Flatiron
school in London.
