    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>My name is Qing. I'm currently a student at Flatiron School. I'm on my way to be a software 
        engineer.
        I am someone who has always sought to learn new things throughout my life; 
        from becoming computer literate in my own time to move from the factory floor to an office job, 
        to deciding to learn English to go to university after working for several years. 
        In my prevous role at a British import/export company I have been finding chances to automate small pieces of work with Python.  
        I know that I would like to take this much further and make it the next stage of my career.
